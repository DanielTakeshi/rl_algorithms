# Reinforcement_Learning_Algorithms

I will use this repository to implement various reinforcement learning algorithms, because I'm sick of reading them but not really *getting* them. Hence, hopefully this repository will help me understand them better. I will also implement various supporting code as needed, such as for simple custom scenarios like GridWorld. Or I can use OpenAI gym.

Here are the algorithms which I already know quite well and do not plan to implement:

- Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
- Q-Learning, tabular version 
- SARSA, tabular version
- Q-Learning with linear function approximation (implemented in closed-source code, sorry)
- Deep Q-Networks, vanilla version (understood via [spragnur's deep_q_rl code](https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl) as well as [my personal fork](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/deep_q_rl))

Here are the algorithms currently implemented or in progress (indicated with WIP):

- Learning with Options (WIP)
- G-Learning (WIP)

# References

I have read a number of paper references to help me out. Here are the papers that I have read, numbered on a (1) to (5) scale where a (1)  means I essentially haven't read it yet, while a (5) means I feel confident that I understand almost everything about the paper. Within a single year, these papers should be organized according to publication date, which gives an idea of how these contributions were organized.
